# RDLRT Stakepool for Cardano

A simplistic pool operator who is here to hope contribute better to the ecosystem. I will not be trying to market my pool, or try to use my pool as "business", because it is not :smile: .

For any queries/suggestions/chat (no investment/trade/speculative topics please), you can reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/rdlrtpool). **Please** join this group for any updates/announcements. My cardano forum profile is [here](https://forum.cardano.org/u/rdlrt).

> Since we do not want to encourage a race to bottom, a nominal margin change does not affect delegator rewards much (reward pot of 75K v/s 74.6K distributed between delegators for a sample scenario), *AND* a vote was taken with the delegators who did join the group to see how After a vote with delegators [here](https://t.me/rdlrtpool/448), it was decided to increase the margin by 2% , the additional 2% will go as a donation! Please refer to the [thread](https://t.me/rdlrtpool/447) for further information and rationale.

For FAQ/guides, I strongly recommend you to visit/contribute to the community support [portal](https://cardano-community/support-faq) - that we are working on.
