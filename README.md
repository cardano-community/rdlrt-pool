# RDLRT Stakepool for Cardano

A simplistic pool operator who is here to hope contribute better to the ecosystem. I will not be trying to market my pool, or try to use my pool as "business", because it is not :smile: .

For any queries/suggestions/chat (no investment/trade/speculative topics please), you can reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/rdlrtpool) , [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/u/rdlrt).

For FAQ/guides, I strongly recommend you to visit/contribute to the community support [portal](https://cardano-community/support-faq) - that we are working on.
